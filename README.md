GZ RemoteFTP
===================


GZ RemoteFTP is a simple and easy to use online FTP manager. It's best suited for situations where you need to move some files or directories between two remote servers.

This script is written in **PHP** and requires PHP 5.5+ (Older versions would probably also work)


**Known Issues**
* Download function saves the data inside `app` directory and ignores `param 0`

Installation and Usage
-------------

There is nothing special about this script, It's just another PHP script with no extra dependencies. So, grab the files, put them in a server with PHP support and run `index.php` in your browser.
Read the notes on the right side in the index file before you start upload/downloading.
